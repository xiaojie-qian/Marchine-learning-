# Marchine learning with Python
## Description 
- **Describe the various types of Machine Learning algorithms and when to use them**
- **Compare and contrast linear classification methods including multiclass prediction, support vector machines, and logistic regression** 
- **Write Python code that implements various classification techniques including K-Nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and regression trees**
- **Evaluate the results from simple linear, non-linear, and multiple regression on a data set using evaluation metrics**
